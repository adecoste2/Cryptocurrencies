# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new type of investment. This was accomplished by preprossesing data supplied in crypto_data.csv to include only active trading cryptocurrencies. Then a three-dimensional graph was constructed to demonstrate how the various cryptocurrencies are organised. Finally, a 2D scatterplot was created to display the link between total coin supply and total coins mined.
